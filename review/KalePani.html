            <h3>About the Author</h3> <p>"Kale Pani" this very romantic book was composed by Hindurhiday Samrat Swatantra Veer Savarkar. His first book "THE INDIAN WAR OF INDEPENDANCE 1857" was first published in 1909. The real name of Veer Savarkar is "Vinayak Damodar Savarkar," but due to his great work and sacrifices which he made for independace of India people started addtessing him as  Swarantra Veer Savarkar. He faught very bravely in the war of independace and also went to the Andaman island for the punishment of kale pani.</p>
            <h3>About the Book</h3> <p>Though this book is imaginary narrative fiction, the story in this book is not completely imaginary it is a mixture of two, three real events. The story of the book takes place in early nineteenth century, when India was under the british rule we get lots of information about that time we understand how british rulers used to troubled the Indian people.<br> Though this book includes lots of plots the main plot in this book is "Andaman island" where british rulers used to send that everyone who spoke against them for the punishment of Kale pani. Writer is successfully reached to his desire to described the condition of priseners of Kale Pani, difficulties faced by them we also get to know about the life of people who faught in 1857's war. The main theme of this book is "opposite gender attraction is not only for sometimes, but the true love means affection, taking care of someone which lasts for the life." speciality of this book is vey beautiful and sweet description of apperance and feeling and sensations of a teenager beautiful girl.</p>
            <h3>Language of the Book and Writing Style</h3> <p>The language used by writer is very sweet asthetic romantic Marathi language. It is a short and crisp book which includes 22 chapters in 288 pages. Some sanskrit words used by the writer enhanced the beauty of the book writer also used some figure of speech to make sentences meaningful.</p>
            <h3>My Opinion About the Book</h3> <p>Every teenager and youth should read this book  to experice the versatility in Savarkar's writting and his way to convey messages to the readers, because it gives the message that "beauty lies in the eyes of beholder." Through this book we can explore some parts of history, we understood cultures of some groups who live in jungle and this book is fill of curiosity and mystry. I think this book is exception to the thinking which says "Savarkar writing include only realistic and rude events."</p>
            <h3>Morral</h3> <p>Love means not only attraction towards opposite gender but it is faith, affection, care. Beautiful appearance doesn't matter, the beauty which matter is beauty of the soul.</p>
